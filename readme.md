## Heart Disease Prediction

Heart disease is the number one cause of death worldwide. To learn how to prevent heart disease we must first learn to reliably detect it.Our dataset is from a study of heart disease that has been open to the public for many years. The study collects various measurements on patient health and cardiovascular statistics, and of course makes patient identities anonymous.

The model has been built using random forest. Auc-Roc is used for the evaluation. Sample starter XGboost code is also provided. An extensive approach to find the optimized parameters is also used.
